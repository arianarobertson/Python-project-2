Task 2.5 – Model Update Summary

App: recipes

Original Models (from Exercise 2.3):
- Recipe
- RecipeIngredient
- RecipeCategory

Changes Made:
1. Added an `image` attribute to the `Recipe` model:
   - Type: ImageField
   - Purpose: To allow users to upload a visual representation of the recipe (cover image).
   - Default: 'no_image.jpg' (to ensure fallback if user does not upload an image)

2. Added `get_absolute_url()` method:
   - Purpose: Supports linking from the recipe list to detail pages using Django’s `reverse()` function.

3. Added `total_time()` and `difficulty()` methods:
   - Purpose: `total_time()` calculates the total time required.
   - `difficulty()` classifies the recipe as Easy / Medium / Hard based on time and number of ingredients.
   - Logic:
     - Easy: <30 minutes & <5 ingredients
     - Medium: <60 minutes & <10 ingredients
     - Hard: Otherwise

Reasons for Changes:
- The image field is needed for frontend display as per Exercise 2.5 instructions.
- The URL and difficulty methods are needed to power navigation and detail view logic, including automated difficulty rating.
- No deletions or migrations between models were necessary.

Next Steps:
- Run `makemigrations` and `migrate`.
- Add image assets (e.g., `no_image.jpg`) in the appropriate media directory.
- Update templates and views t
