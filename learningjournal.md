# Exercise 2.1: Getting Started with Django

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Explain the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture and compare it with MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- Summarize Djangoâ€™s benefits and drawbacks
- Install and get started with Django in a virtual environment

## ðŸ’­ Reflection Questions

### 1. Vanilla Python vs Django: What are the trade-offs?

Using **vanilla Python** for web development offers complete control and minimal overhead, making it ideal for small scripts, learning purposes, or lightweight applications. However, it lacks built-in tools for managing complex features like user authentication, URL routing, and database interactions, requiring everything to be built from scratch.

In contrast, **Django** provides a full-featured framework with a clear structure, security best practices, and an admin interface out of the box. This makes it ideal for larger or production-ready web applications. The trade-off is reduced flexibility and a steeper learning curve for beginners, as you work within Djangoâ€™s conventions.

### 2. MVT vs MVC: Whatâ€™s the biggest advantage of MVT?

The **most significant advantage of Django's MVT architecture** over traditional MVC is the way Django handles the "View" and "Template" layers. In Django, the "View" contains the business logic (like a Controller in MVC), while the "Template" is used strictly for rendering the user interface. This separation allows developers to keep presentation logic (HTML, CSS) separate from Python code, which improves readability and maintainability. It also aligns closely with how web development is naturally structured.

### 3. Personal Learning Goals for This Achievement

1. **Understand Django's Core Concepts**  
   I want to get a strong grasp of Djangoâ€™s foundational components, including models, views, templates, and how they interact through the MVT architecture.

2. **Build a Real Django App**  
   I aim to complete a basic but functional Django project by the end of this Achievement, using routes, templates, and database models to build confidence in full-stack development.

3. **Prepare for Real-World Web Development**  
   After completing this Achievement, I want to be comfortable enough with Django to take on small freelance projects or contribute to open-source Django apps on GitHub.
